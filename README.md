# BloggApp

## Project Overview
I build the back end of this blog in Django, complete with an admin for adding new blog content. 
Then you’ll expose the content data as a Django API and use templates to display that data in the browser. 
We’ve seen how using Django models makes dealing with your database extremely simple.
We’ve seen how we can use templates to make generic HTML files that can be reused easily depending on what data we want to look at.
And We’ve seen how to wire these two parts together using views to pull data dynamically and present it to the user.
Lastly, we set up the admin interface to make adding new data super easy.
